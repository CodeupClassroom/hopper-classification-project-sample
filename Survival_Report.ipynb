    "# How to survive a passenger shipwreck\n",

    "\n",
    "## Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to identifty the attributes of passengers who survived the Titanic shipwreck in order to make receommendations of the best way to travel on a ship to maximize chance of survival should the ship run into a devastating end. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The weather is getting more and more extreme and unpredictable. We often think of the Titanic is something in the past that won't happen again. However, these events could become more frequent with the change in the oceanic warming and atmospheric changes. We will analyze the attributes of passengers who were more or less likely to survive, develop a model for predicting survival based on those attributes, and leave with both recommendations for future passengers and predictions of survival for a list of passengers on the next ship leaving (delivered via csv). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Was the phrase \"women and children first\" just a myth or did they really try to get out women and children first? If so, they would show as more likely to survive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do those who travel first class get quicker access to life boats? \n",
    "\n",
    "Do families with small children get priority access? Even if they at the bottom of the boat in 3rd class? \n",
